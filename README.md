<h2 align="center">What is this?</h2><div align="center">
<i>The goal is that you complete missions to grow your world border. As of 29/03/2024 only missions are complete but you can complete them and they work fine (Even including a gui). This will be sold as a server setup for $30 per copy</i>

<h2 align="center">Leaking?</h2><div align="center">
<i>To deal with any leaking we will be adding a license to the main plugin to ensure that none of it get leaks. Why not the rest of the server and not just the main plugin? Instead of using Public plugins as the core.. In this setup the core will be completely self made.</i>
